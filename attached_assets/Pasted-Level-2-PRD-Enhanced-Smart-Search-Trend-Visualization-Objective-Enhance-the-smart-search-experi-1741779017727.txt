Level 2 PRD: Enhanced Smart Search & Trend Visualization

Objective:
Enhance the smart search experience by introducing intelligent user preferences, better clustering and visualization of search results, and a robust trends analysis system, incorporating sentiment analysis and metadata-based ranking for credibility.

1. Smart Search Preferences

Directive: Implement an advanced preference selection system to allow users to refine their search experience based on relevance, geography, credibility, and topic clusters.

User-Specific Source Preferences

Enable selection of multiple sources within a category (e.g., news & media: Indian, European, US, etc.).

Filter sources based on user-defined relevance, allowing exclusion of geographically irrelevant sources.

Option for dynamic personalization based on frequent user selections.

Sorting Based on Credibility

Implement metadata ranking using Brave Search API, leveraging domain authority, backlink count, and engagement scores.

Algorithm-driven ranking function prioritizing sources with higher credibility.

Optional credibility-based filtering (e.g., prioritize peer-reviewed sources for academic searches).

2. Enhanced Clustered Search Results & Visualization

Directive: Improve the way search results are grouped and presented visually to enhance user engagement and ease of discovery.

Cluster Similar Search Results

Implement a proximity-based clustering algorithm to group similar topics.

Use an interactive visualization inspired by music-map.com where similar topics are placed closer together.

The map appears alongside the traditional search result cards to provide an intuitive overview of topic relevance.

Visual Cues for Relevance & Popularity

Top-ranked results should have subtle highlights or badges (e.g., "Trending," "Most Cited").

In-page search result segmentation: separate results into "High Credibility," "Trending," and "New & Emerging".

3. Trend Tracking & Sentiment Visualization

Directive: Introduce a comprehensive trends tracking system with historical search pattern analysis and sentiment detection.

Word Cloud Visualization on the Trends Page

Dynamically generated word cloud showing the most talked-about topics.

Color-coded words:

Green/Blue: Positive sentiment.

Red/Orange: Negative sentiment.

Neutral colors for neutral/mixed sentiment.

Larger words indicate higher frequency/hot topics.

Tracking Trends Over Time

Store short-term search trends temporarily in an in-memory database.

Analyze repeated search frequency over days/weeks to detect emerging "hot topics".

Consider leveraging Brave ranking metadata to detect trending searches globally.

Sentiment Analysis for Trends

AI-driven sentiment analysis using Hugging Face Transformers.

Track sentiment shifts over time (e.g., "textile sustainability" sentiment moving from positive to negative in industry news).

Generate summary insights on sentiment trends: "The sentiment around 'carbon neutrality' has turned more positive this month due to government policy changes."

4. AI Integration & Cost-Efficient Processing

Directive: Introduce lightweight AI functionalities where necessary while avoiding unnecessary computational costs.

Summarization & Sentiment Analysis

Batch process search summaries periodically to optimize API usage.

Use Hugging Faceâ€™s local models for text summarization and sentiment classification where possible.

Optionally integrate Claude Sonnet API for premium users needing deeper AI-driven insights.

Backend Algorithm for Ranking Credibility

Develop a credibility ranking algorithm based on metadata from search sources.

Factors considered: domain age, peer-reviewed status, user engagement, Brave metadata.

Next Steps for Replit Agent

Implement dynamic smart search preferences with a user-friendly interface.

Develop a clustering mechanism with a proximity-based visualization for related search results.

Build a sentiment-tracking system, word cloud visualization, and sentiment trend analysis.

Integrate Brave metadata for credibility ranking and trending topic detection.

Optimize AI summarization and sentiment analysis through cost-effective means.

Develop a credibility-based ranking system for sources.

This specification outlines the roadmap for Replit development to improve search intelligence, result clarity, and trend-tracking capabilities.
